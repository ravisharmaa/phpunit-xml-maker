With an obligation to create ```xml``` file to begin to write Tests in ```phpunit```  the ```phpunit.xml``` file always 
comes in the way. Honestly got fed up with searching ```phpunit.xml``` in on others repo. 
This makes it easy to create the xml file in just one command.


```php please make:xml```

makes the xml file which helps you to go forwards with writing your tests.


Future releases and features include:
<br>
Interactive console commands which lets you choose the options for various attributes.
