With an obligation to create ```xml``` file on the beginning of writing tests in ```phpunit```  the ```phpunit.xml``` file always 
comes forth. If you can remember the xml configs then fine, if not then this tool would help you create
```phpunit.xml``` easily in just one command.

```php please make:xml```

The command is dead simple, and self explanatory.
